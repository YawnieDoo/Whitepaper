  <h2>1. Executive Summary</h2>
  <p>Meet Yawnie Doo — the lovable, slow-moving pup inspired by the iconic Scooby Doo, but with a twist: instead of chasing adventures or fame, Yawnie Doo chases naps. With his floppy ears, sleepy grin, and a yawn that could charm any blockchain, he’s not just a mascot — he’s a mood. While others chase hype and frantic market moves, Yawnie Doo reminds us that sometimes the best way to ride the waves is by taking a calm, restful pause. Yawnie Doo embodies the spirit of low stress and high fun, offering a fresh take on meme culture with a message that it’s okay to slow down and just chill — even in the fast-paced crypto world.</p>
<p>Beyond fun and memes, Yawnie Doo carries a deeper message backed by science: taking life too seriously can harm both our mental and physical health. Stress and panic during tough times — whether in finances, relationships, or life’s challenges — often make situations worse. Yawnie Doo encourages you to pause, relax, and face adversity with calm and resilience. This token isn’t just about laughs; it stands for a healthier, balanced approach to life and success. Because sometimes, the smartest move is to yawn, take a nap, and come back stronger.</p>

  <h2>8. Community and Governance</h2>
  <p>
    At the heart of <strong>Yawnie Doo</strong> lies its most powerful force — the community. We believe that every meme, every nap, and every step forward should be shaped by the people who believe in the Yawnie Doo vision. That’s why our community isn’t just along for the ride — they’re in the driver’s seat (or rather, the comfy couch).
  </p>

  <p>
    Yawnie Doo thrives on community engagement, creativity, and shared vibes. From spreading memes to participating in discussions, events, and decision-making, every holder has a voice. We encourage an open, inclusive environment where all sleepyheads, chill investors, and meme lovers can contribute their ideas, talents, and energy.
  </p>

  <h3>Governance</h3>
  <p>
    Yawnie Doo will implement a community-driven governance model, allowing token holders to vote on key decisions related to the project’s future. This includes proposals on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Development priorities and feature updates</li>
    <li>Community initiatives and partnerships</li>
    <li>Fund allocation from community wallets</li>
    <li>Future roadmap phases and token utility expansions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Governance will evolve gradually, starting with team-led proposals and eventually transitioning to decentralized decision-making through <strong>Yawnie Doo DAO</strong> (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This ensures that as the project grows, power and influence shift naturally to the community.
  </p>

  <h3>Community Values</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chill and Respect</strong> – Everyone’s welcome, no pressure, no stress.</li>
    <li><strong>Participation</strong> – Meme, share, suggest, and vote — every action counts.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency</strong> – Open communication, honest updates, and clear decision processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Wellness First</strong> – We promote a positive, balanced approach to crypto and life.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Yawnie Doo isn’t just a token — it’s a community-powered movement built on the idea that good vibes, humor, and health-conscious values can create lasting impact in Web3.
